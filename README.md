In this work it is studied the electrical and structural properties of a doped graphene nanoribbon.
The calculations are based on the density functional theory and all the calculations are performed with Quantum ESPRESSO.
The graphene nanoribbon is composed of 30 atoms of carbon and 4 atoms of hydrogen. A carbon atom is substituted with an atom of germanium (electronic configuration: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p²).
Pseudopotentials used are of the type PBE-GGA.
The image below shows the structural changes of the doped nanoribbon after the relaxation.

After the convergence test for the plane wave function’s expansion, the cutoff energy of 30 Ry is used.

Because of vacancy, it is broken three bonds sp², but the Ge atom saturates the three dangling bonds, while one electron remains non-bonding. 
The images below show PDOS of d-orbitals and their charge density.
