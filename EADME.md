Study ad initio of a graphene nanoribbon and a doped graphene nanoribbon.
The calculations are made with Quantum ESPRESSO.
The graphene nanoribbon is composed of 30 atoms of carbon and 4 atoms of hydrogen.
The image below shows the nanoribbon and the size of cell used.
The coordinates of the input are : ‘DFTB+ Tutorial on 2D Carbon Materials’, di B. Aradi, G. Penazzi and B. Hourahine
